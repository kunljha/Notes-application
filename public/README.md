# Notes-application

- This project is a Note-taking application where users can save their important notes.
- Users can also search for a specific note(s) because the app has a filter bar to filter the required notes.
- I also added a dropdown menu so that the users can sort their notes as well.
- This Notes app uses Moment.js library to format dates so that the users can know how much time its been while they last edited their note.
